      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Pramil Shrestha, a computer science student at the University of Idaho. 
        I’m passionate about coding, problem-solving, and building projects that make a difference.
        My interests include web development, software engineering, and exploring new 
        programming tools using LLMs and AI models. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and writing 
        code that is simple to understand and maintain. This site is part of my practice 
        to structure projects in a clear, professional way. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I also enjoy hiking, photography, and spending time outdoors when I’m not coding. My favorite sports 
        are football and cricket. I’m always eager to connect with others who share similar interests. 
        I also love to play chess and video games during my free time.
